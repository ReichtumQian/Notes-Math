\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Calculate
  \begin{equation}
    I = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{e^z}{z(1-z)^3} \mathrm{d} z,
  \end{equation}
  where $C$ is a closed contour that does not pass through $z = 0$ and $z = 1$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Denote the region enclosed by $C$ as $D$.
  If $D$ does not contain $z = 0$ and $z = 1$, then the integral is zero.
  If only contains $z = 0$, then the integral is $1$.
  If only contains $z = 1$, then the integral is $- \frac{e}{2}$.
  If contains both $z = 0$ and $z = 1$, then the integral is $1 - \frac{e}{2}$.
\end{solution}
