\subsection{Concept of Measurable Functions}

\begin{definition}{Measurable Function}{}
  Let $f$ be a function defined on a measurable set $D$.
  If for any real number $\alpha$, the set
  \begin{equation}
    \{x \in D: f(x) > \alpha\}
  \end{equation}
  is measurable, then $f$ is said to be a \emph{measurable function on $D$}.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Approximation by Simple Functions}

\begin{definition}{Simple Function}{}
  Let $f$ be a function defined on a measurable set $D$, satisfying
  \begin{equation}
    f(x) = a_k, \quad x \in E_k,
  \end{equation}
  where $a_k$ is a constant and $D = \cup _{k = 1}^n E_k$.
  Then $f$ is said to be a \emph{simple function on $D$}.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Approximation by Continuous Functions}

\begin{theorem}{Egoroff Theorem}{}
  Let $f$ and $f_n$ be measurable functions that are almost-everywhere finite
  on a set $D$ of finite measure.
  If $f_n$ converges almost-everywhere to $f$ on $D$,
  then for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a closed subset $F$ of $D$,
  such that $m(D - F) < \epsilon$
  and $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $F$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}{Lusin Theorem}{}
  Let $f$ be a almost-everywhere finite measurable function on a measurable set
  $D$.
  Then for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a continuous function $f^{\ast}$ on
  $D$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    m(\{f \neq f^{\ast}\}) < \epsilon, \quad
    \sup \limits_{x \in D} |f^{\ast}(x)| \leq \sup \limits_{x \in D} |f(x)|.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\section{Convergence in Measure}

\begin{definition}{Convergence in Measure}{}
  Let $f$ and $f_n$ be measurable functions that are finite almost everywhere on
  a measurable set $D$. If for any $\delta > 0$,
  \begin{equation}
    \lim \limits _{n \rightarrow \infty} m(\{|f_n - f| \geq \delta\}) = 0,
  \end{equation}
  then we say that $f_n$ \emph{converges to $f$ in measure on $D$}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}{Riesz Theorem}{}
  Let $f$ and $f_n$ be measurable functions that are finite almost everywhere on
  a measurable set $D$. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $f_n$ converges to $f$ in measure, then there exists a subsequence of
    $f_n$ that converges to $f$ almost everywhere;
  \item If $m(D) < \infty$ and $f_n$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere,
    then $f_n$ converges to $f$ in measure.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
