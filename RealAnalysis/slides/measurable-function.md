## Key Points of Measurable Function

<br>

- **Measurable Function**: $\{f > a\}$, $\{f \geq a\}$, $\{f = a\}$ etc. are measurable.
- **Boundedness**: $f$ is basically bounded; $\{f_n\}$ are basically uniformly bounded.
- **Closure under Operations**: $\pm$, $\times$, $/$, $\sup$, $\inf$, $\limsup$, $\liminf$.
- **Closure under Composition**: $f$ is continuous, $g$ is finite and measurable, then $f(g)$ is measurable.

## Approximation by Simple and Continuous Functions

<br>

- **Approximation by Simple Functions**: $\lim \limits _{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n(x) = f(x)$, $x \in E$.
- **Approximation by Continuous Functions (Lusin)**: Basically continuous on finite measure set.

## Convergence Results in Measure Theory

<br>

- **Pointwise to Uniform (Egoroff)**: Basically on finite measure set.
- **Measure to Pointwise (Riesz)**: There exists a subsequence.
- **Pointwise to Measure (Lebesgue)**: On finite measure set.
